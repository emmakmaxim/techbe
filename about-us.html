    TechBE was started in 2014 with the goal of developing innovative software solutions for Canadian businesses.
    We have worked with organisations across the private, public, and non-profit sectors to deliver a range of
    applications and websites.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our multi-disciplinary team has extensive experience in full-stack development, user experience, and requirements management.
    We work closely with our clients to ensure that every project meets its users' needs and drives engagement. Whether you are looking
    for a robust software application, a custom website to increase customer engagement or an innovative application to change
    the paradigm of your organisation, TechBE can drive your business into the future.
    <br>
    <br>
    At TechBE, we stick to three core principles in our design and development:

      <li>Understanding our clients' requirements is our first priority</li>
      <li>Every user deserves a superstar experience</li>
      <li>Mobile-first means every device wins</li>
    </ol>
